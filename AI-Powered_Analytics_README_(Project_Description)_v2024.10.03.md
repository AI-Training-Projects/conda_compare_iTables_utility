## Project Name: a descriptive title (should be "catchy" for marketing purposes)

## Project and "Work Product" Description:  (should be 1 CONCISE paragraph, 3-7 sentences)
    • Define the **business problem** being solved (aka "opportunity" to provide what's missing.)
	• Answer "This project / work product (solution) fills these gaps... "
	• Main goals and problem(s) it solves.
	• Problem and Solution Workflow Diagrams (2 flowcharts "AS-IS" and "TO-BE")

    "A problem clearly stated is a problem half-solved." - Dorothea Brande :

## Description of Solution:  (should be CONCISE, 3-7 sentences)
	• Software functions for solving problem(s) step by step.
	• Workflow diagram of future ("TO-BE") state (improved processes from your solution).
	• "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) 1.0 delivered.  (V1.x delivered beyond MVP V1.0?)
    • Additional requirements, Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), usability, etc. for later versions
    
### Solution Design (high-level):
    • Architecture Design Diagram (Client-Server-DB Block Diagram?) 
    • User Interface Mockup (wireframe?)

### Solution Code Description (low-level design): 
	• Describe code (to help users understand it.)
	• Hyperlinks to actual complete code  

### Actual Working Product Code: 
    Packages, modules, functions, documentation 
        packages that are required (from other people)
        Custom packages, modules, classes, functions that you created
        
## Application Instructions:
    • Step-by-step instructions for USERS of your Application:
        Instructions for other people to install, set-up, and use your software:
        Everything needed to get your solution working.   
            Software packages and tools
            Configuration, data sets, URLs, input and output folder structure, etc. 
    • Additional Important Guidelines for Product Usability (for others to use your work products):

## Future Enhancements
	• Later MVPs, i.e., v2, v3, vN+ functionality to be delivered? 

## Lessons Learned: 
    • Any skills or knowledge acquired by doing the projects
    • Hard and software skills:
        Coding, Tools, Packages
        Software Engineering Specification and any other technical hands-on work
        Project Management, communication, collaboration, strategy, delivery 
        Presentation skills

### Lessons Learned EXAMPLES:
    • Specifying project through the SDLC lifecycle (requirements engineering end-to-end)
    • Applying state-of-the-art AI code generation tools (VSCode) to Real-time Data Analysis and Reporting
